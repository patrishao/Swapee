4.	Ratings – users can give out ratings to one another to inform other users if that specific person is legitimate or trustworthy. This would eliminate the risks of scams.

5.	User details – On a specific post page, it gives out the city of the seller to let the users know if they’re nearby to the seller, which then could prompt their interest as they know that it’s not too far to pick up the item. Additionally, users can plan where to meet up as they already have their location.

6.	Feature a post – a way to prioritize a post to be always shown at the top of the page. A featured item will always be highlighted and will be one of the first items the other users will see.
